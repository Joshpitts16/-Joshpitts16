My Name Is Josh and I am an IT major at East Tennessee State University.  I have really enjoyed my programming classes up to this point and look forward to learning more this semester.  Outside of School I work two part time jobs one as an IT Intern, and the other as a bike mechanic.  I also race mountain bikes (Downhill and Enduro) and will have about 6 or 7 races this semester.
